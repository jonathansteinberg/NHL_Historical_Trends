# NHL_Historical_Trends

• Participated in monthly conversations with Mike Kelly, Director of Media & Content at Sportlogiq and Analyst at NHL Network, where we discussed the sports industry and analytical frameworks

• Created a dashboard for fans to view the evolution of certain statistical categories throughout NHL history

• Collected almost a century worth of statistics from NHL.com and Hockey-Reference.com such as win percentage when scoring first, leading by 1st or 2nd period, and when outshooting opponent or getting outshot respectively
